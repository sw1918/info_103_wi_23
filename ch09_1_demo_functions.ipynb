    "# Demo: Writing Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can do our demo of tracking function use, we need to learn how to create functions in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions allow us to run another computer program. In our recipe analogy earlier, we said it was like:\n",
    "\n",
    "`- Make the dumpling dough (see recipe on page 42).`\n",
    "\n",
    "Or\n",
    "\n",
    "`- to make dumplings vegan, make the dumpling dough (see recipe on page 42), but instead of using the egg, subsititute 2 teaspoons olive oil and 2 tablespoons hot water.`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Functions\n",
    "There are several advantages to creating and using functions in computer programs, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Reusing code instead of repeating code__: When we find ourselves repeating a set of actions in our program, we end up writing (or copying) the same code multiple times. If we put that repeated code in a function, then we only have to write it once and then use that function in all the places we were repeating the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Single, standardized definitions__: Let's say we made code that takes a name and tries to split it into a first name and last name, and we have that code copied in several places in our program. Then we realize that our code isn't handling some last names correctly, like \"O'Reilly\" and \"Del Toro.\" If we fix this bug in one of the places the code is copied in our program it still will be broken elsewhere, so we have to find all the places and fix it there. If, on the other hand we had the code to split names in a function, and used that function everywhere else, then we only have to fix the bug inside that one function and our code everywhere is fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Code organization__: Making functions also can help us organize our code. It lets us give a name to a block of code, and when we use it, those function names can help make the code more understandable. Making code as functions also helps in letting us put those pieces of code in other files or in code libraries, so the file we are working on is smaller and easier to manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been using many functions so far in this book, such as:\n",
    "- `display(2 + 2)`\n",
    "- `sleep(3)`\n",
    "- `client.create_tweet(text=\"This is a tweet\")`\n",
    "- `sentence.upper()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will be defining our own functions, which we can then use later in our code."
